<h1>POEM1</h1>
<h2>THE ROSE FAMTLY </h2>
open<p>
 
The rose is a rose
and was always a rose
But the apple's a rose
And the pear is, And so's
The plum, I suppose
The dear only knows
What will next prove a rose
You of couse, are a rose 
But wore always a rose
 
</p>
<b><u><i><POEM>
<u><b><i>AWAKING IN BENGUL URU<lu></b></i>
<pre> <p>

curtains forcing their will
against the wind
children sleep
exechanging dreams with
serphim, The city
drags it self awake on
subway straps; and
lie stretching into dawn
unasked and unheeded
